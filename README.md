## Introduction

This project contains an application which can be used to:
- Create a new bank account with an initial deposit for a customer.
  - A single customer may have multiple accounts.
- Transfer amounts between two accounts, including those owned by different customers.
- Retrieve balance for a given account.
- Retrieve transaction history for a given account.

## Technologies Used

- Java 11
- [SpringBoot](https://start.spring.io/): Used to create easy stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- [H2 database engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html): Embedded relational database
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/): Swagger is an Interface Description Language for describing RESTful APIs expressed using JSON. Swagger is used together with a set of open-source software tools to design, build, document, and use RESTful web services. Swagger includes automated documentation, code generation, and test-case generation.
- [Git Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): GitHub Actions helps automate tasks within the software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. They happen directly on the Github repo itself.
